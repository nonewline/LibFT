Libft is a library we created in C to help us during the WeThinkCode journey.

## WeThinkCode:

**Part 1:** 28/28  
**Part 2:** 24/24  
**Bonus:**  6/6  
**Five Extra:** 5/5  
  
**Total:** 125/125

## Installation:

To get started, clone the Libft repo and go into the folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/nonewline/libft
cd ./libft/libft/
```

### Making:

To compile the libft, you need to run the following commands:

```
make
```

## Using the library:

To use the library, you need to add "#include "libft.h"" in your name and change the directory of your libft.h.
If you add a function to the library, you'll need to add the function in the libft.h file and the Makefile.

### Compiling with libft.a

Run the following command, by adding your main file and all other files you want to compile.

```
gcc [Your Main] [Other Files] libft.a
./a.out
```

Don't just use his code without his permission.

## Don't be a GitHub hero!

It won't help just stealing code. Come talk to one of the NoNewLine members if you're unsure about how something works.  
[Fred](https://github.com/fwmoor) wrote this with help from the rest of the NoNewLine members. Any of them will be able to help you!  
Also, check out the rest of the NoNewLine repos. You might find something cool!  
Thanks!
